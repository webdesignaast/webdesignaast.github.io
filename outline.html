It is based on the self-learning and de-learning process.The students will be exposed to various movements such as the smart city and the DIY (Do It Yourself) and more.<br />
    It is kind of an extended workshop where the student is supposed to design an interactive assistive gadget for the disabled along with designing and creating their own website and learn how to connect their gadget's data to their website. The design process of the gadget design and the website design will begin from day 1 and the student will continue to develop their work in parallel to the tutorials handed by the tutors.</p>   </div>

    <p>The students will be required to design a prototype of an <strong>interactive assistive gadget for the disabled</strong> to assist them in a specific area of their lives.In order to do that you will be asked to experiment this disability yourself. You will begin working on the design from week 1 and will start executing it from week 7 to be submitted by the end of the term.<br />
